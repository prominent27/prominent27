- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @prominent27 and I'm an electronics engineering student
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning to program in different languages, so far I only know the basics of programming languages, with the little I know I plan to carry out small projects focused on my career.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to program in python, JavaScript and use html with CSS for web page design
- ðŸ“« How to reach me, for the time being, I will not use my social networks and emails due to the privacy issue
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: michi :3
- âš¡ Fun fact: I really like programming, but sometimes I feel like I don't know where to start
